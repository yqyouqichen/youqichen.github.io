## **Derivative**  
A security that derives its value from the value or return of another asset or security
+ *Exchange-traded*: standardized, backed by a clearning house
+ *Over-the-counter*: counterparty, defaulty risk


## **Forward Commitment** 
A legally binding promise to perform some action in the future.

### Forward Contracts
One party agress to buy and the counterparty to sell a physical or financial asset at a specific price (*forward price*) on a specific date in the future.

+ *Long Forward Position*: the party to the forward contract who agrees to buy the financial or physical asset 
+ *Short Forward Position*: the party to the forward contract who agrees to sell/deliver the financial or physical asset 

Forward contract as a value of zero at the initiation of the contract.

+ *Deliverable Forward Contract*: settled by the short delivering the underlying asset to the long 
+ *Cash-settled Forward Contract* / *Contracts for Differences* / *Non-deliverable Forwards (NDFs)*: pays cash based on the difference between the forward price and the market price of the underlying asset at the settlement date


### Futures Contracts
**Futures vs Forward**
+ Similarities
  * can be either deliverable or cash-settled contracts
  * have contract prices set so each side of the contract has a value of zero at the initiation of the contract.
