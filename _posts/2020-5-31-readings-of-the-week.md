## Articles

### [Why is the Market Doing Well Lately?](https://obliviousinvestor.com/why-is-the-market-doing-well-lately/) by *Mike Piper*

+ **Stock Market**:
+ **Economy**: all activities related to *production, consumption, and trade of goods and services* in an area. 
    + *Microeconomics* studies the decisions of individuals and firms resource allocation (incentives and behaviors, utility, production theory, price); 
    + *Macroeconomics* studies the economy-wide phenomena (inflation, rate of economic growth, income, GDP, unemployment)
+ **Expected Value of Earnings**

> The value of stock market at any given time is essentially the market's concensus as to the present value of the expected future earnings of publicly traded companies.
> The stock market's valuation is based on an "expected" (i.e., probability-weighted) value of earnings

### [This is the Thing The Bears Hate Most](https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/05/26/this-is-the-thing-the-bears-hate-most/) by *Joshua M Brown*

+ **Expectation**

> One very crucial thing about market participants - they don't care about Good or Bad. [...] The only two words that matter - Better or Worse. Don't tell me employment is good or bad, tell me if its better or worse than expected. Don't tell me if Nvidia had a good quarter, tell me if it was better or worse than expectations.


### [Hindsigh Bias Free for All](https://ritholtz.com/2020/05/hindsight-bias-free-for-all/) by *Barry Ritholtz*

+ **Hindsight Bias**: the *ex-post* recollection of the *ex-ante* probability of an event will be biased in the direction of the event's realization.

Hindsight biased emphasizes the importance of *narrative* because people raipidly rewrite their memories of the past to fit what they have learned so that they misremember how little they knew before the event. 

For example, 

> But here is the thing: None of the people who remember calling the crash are liars, they are simply humans. Our cognitive processes evolved to facilitate adaptation and survival on the savannah, not financial decision making or capital risk taking in markets. This is why traders are adviced to keep a trading journal, sign a prenup before they make each trade. When they  do their post-mortem for a trade gone wrong, they can see exactly what they were thinking in black & white, freed from the vicissitudes of faulty recall and biased memories. 

>This is why forcasting is so difficult. Markets are probabilistic mechanisms, collectively allocating capital with imperfect information about an inherently unknowable future. But that's merely *priori* issue; add to that a *posteriori*: our all too human tendency to rationalize, to misremember, to lie to ourselves, which makes learning from our failures all the more difficult.

### [A One-of-a-Kind Market Environment](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/05/a-one-of-a-kind-market-environment/) by *Ben Carlson*

> One of the reasons history doesn't repeat or rhyme is because there is always stuff happening that has never happened before.

### [The Three Sides of Risk](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/) by *Morgan Housel*

+ **tail-end events**

> \[...] three distinct sides of risk:
  + **The odds you will get hit.**
  + **The average consequences of getting hit.**
  + **The tail-end consequences of getting hit.**
  >> In investing, the average consequences of risk make up most of the daily news headlines. But the tail-end consequences of risk - like pandemics, and depressions - are what make the pages of history books.
