# Concepts Review 

## Why is the Market Doing Well Lately? from Obvious Investor

The author summarized two reasons behind the divergence between "the stock market" and "the economy".

+ Stock Market:

Stock market only concerned with the profitability of publicly traded companies. Therefore, it does not move in the same proportion with unemployment.
The profitability is related to unemployment dependning on the duration of the high employment and the jobs that are lost.

+ Expected Value of Earnings:

Expectation 

> The value of stock amrket at any given time is essentially the market's concensus as to the present value of the expected future earnings of publicly traded companies.
> The stock market's valuation is based on an "expected" (i.e., probability-weighted) value of earnings

## This is the Thing The Bears Hate Most by Joshua M Brown

The author describes a process where companies cur their full year guidance and "beat expectations" by achieving lower-than-former-estimation earnings. 

+ Reference Point
+ Investor Sentiment
+ Expectation

> One very crucial thing about market participants - they don't care about Good or Bad. [...] The only two words that matter - Better or Worse. Don't tell me employment is good or bad, tell me if its better or worse than expected. Don't tell me if Nvidia had a good quarter, tell me if it was better or worse than expectations.
