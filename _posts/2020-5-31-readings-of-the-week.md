### [Why is the Market Doing Well Lately?](https://obliviousinvestor.com/why-is-the-market-doing-well-lately/) by *Mike Piper*

> The value of stock market at any given time is essentially the market's concensus as to the present value of the expected future earnings of publicly traded companies.

+ **Stock Market**: the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issurance of shares of *publicly-held* companies take place. 
    + The activties can take place in stock exchanges or over-the-counter(OTC). 
    + Stock market acts as *primary markets* for companies to issue and sell their shares for the first time through initial public offering (IPO); the market parcitipants then trade the securities they already own in *secondary markets*. 
    + Market indicators (e.g. S&P 500) are developed to measure the movement of the overall market.

+ **Economy**: all activities related to *production, consumption, and trade of goods and services* in an area. 
    + *Microeconomics* studies the decisions of individuals and firms resource allocation (incentives and behaviors, utility, production theory, price); 
    + *Macroeconomics* studies the economy-wide phenomena (inflation, rate of economic growth, income, GDP, unemployment)
 
 
> The stock market's valuation is based on an "expected" (i.e., probability-weighted) value of earnings 

+ **Expected Return**: probability-weighted rates of return on an investment. It is calculated by summing up all products of potential outcome and the change of occuring. For example, if an investment has 10% chance of gaining 20%, 50% chance of gaining 10%, and 40% chance of losing 5%, the expected return is (0.1 * 20% + 0.5 * 10% + 0.4 * (-5%)) = 5% 


### [This is the Thing The Bears Hate Most](https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/05/26/this-is-the-thing-the-bears-hate-most/) by *Joshua M Brown*

> One very crucial thing about market participants - they don't care about Good or Bad. [...] The only two words that matter - Better or Worse. Don't tell me employment is good or bad, tell me if its better or worse than expected. Don't tell me if Nvidia had a good quarter, tell me if it was better or worse than expectations.

+ **Street Expectation**: the average estimate (*consensus expectation*) of a public company's earnings and revenues from securities analysts who provide research covereage on the company. 
    + Missing Street expectations are perceived as negative and trigger decline in the stock. Beating expectations generally considered good signals and trigger appreciation in the stock.
    + A company needs to beat the average analyst forcast for *both* sales and EPS to exceed Street expectations
    + An analyst collects information by speaking with the company's management, research the company, analyze the industry, and then creates a mathmetical model with the information and his or her own judgement. 
    + Companies want to collaborate with analysts to manage expectations
    
+ **Earnings Guidance**: alternatively refered to as *Company Guidance* or *Forward-looking Statement*. It is a report released by a public company to its shareholders on the earnings it to achieve in the quarter or fiscal year ahead.
    + An earnings guidance typically includes revenue estimate, projected earnings, and capital spending estimates.
    + A company typically release its earnings guidance immediately after releasing its latest quarterly earnings report, and may revise upwards or downwards later in the quarter if its outlook changes significantly. 


### [Hindsigh Bias Free for All](https://ritholtz.com/2020/05/hindsight-bias-free-for-all/) by *Barry Ritholtz*

> But here is the thing: None of the people who remember calling the crash are liars, they are simply humans. Our cognitive processes evolved to facilitate adaptation and survival on the savannah, not financial decision making or capital risk taking in markets. This is why traders are adviced to keep a trading journal, sign a prenup before they make each trade. When they  do their post-mortem for a trade gone wrong, they can see exactly what they were thinking in black & white, freed from the vicissitudes of faulty recall and biased memories. 

>This is why forcasting is so difficult. Markets are probabilistic mechanisms, collectively allocating capital with imperfect information about an inherently unknowable future. But that's merely *priori* issue; add to that a *posteriori*: our all too human tendency to rationalize, to misremember, to lie to ourselves, which makes learning from our failures all the more difficult.

+ **Hindsight Bias**: the *ex-post* recollection of the *ex-ante* probability of an event will be biased in the direction of the event's realization. It is a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they had accurately predicted it before it happened.
    + Hindsight biased emphasizes the importance of *narrative* because people raipidly rewrite their memories of the past to fit what they have learned so that they misremember how little they knew before the event. 
    + It can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events
    + Financial bubbles are always subject to substantial hindsight bias after they burst.



### [A One-of-a-Kind Market Environment](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/05/a-one-of-a-kind-market-environment/) by *Ben Carlson*

+ Market Crash: generally considered as abrupt double-digit percentage drop in a stock index over the course of a few days.
    + Well-known U.S. stock market crashes include 1929 Great Depression, Black Monday of 1987, the 2001 dotcom bubble burst, the 2008 financal crisis, and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

> One of the reasons history doesn't repeat or rhyme is because there is always stuff happening that has never happened before.

### [The Three Sides of Risk](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/) by *Morgan Housel*

> \[...] three distinct sides of risk:
  + **The odds you will get hit.**
  + **The average consequences of getting hit.**
  + **The tail-end consequences of getting hit.**
        In investing, the average consequences of risk make up most of the daily news headlines. But the tail-end consequences of risk - like pandemics, and depressions - are what make the pages of history books. 

+ **Tail Risks**: a form of portfolio risk that arises when the possibility that an investment will move more than three standard deviations from the mean is greater than what is shown by a normal distribtion. 
  + Tail risks include events that have a small probability of occuring, and occur at both ends of a normal distribution curve.
  + The assumptions that market returns follow a normal distribution is key to many financial models. Under this assumption, the probability of that returns will move between the mean and three standard deviations, either positive or negative, is approximately 99.7%. However, tail risk suggests that the distribuiton of returns is not normal but skewed and has fatter tails, which indicates a probability (may be small) that an investment will move beyond three standard deviations.
