Hi, my name is Youqi Chen and I am currently a rising senior at UC Berkeley majoring in Economics and Computer Science. I am passionate about the markets, and I will use this site to tracking my learning and exploration in the finance and business world.

### Interests

I enjoy reading detective stories, listening to Cantopop, and hiking!
